	Anti-Stasi Ultimate, House Kandosii Extention, Star Wars

# Description
	A Star Wars extention for Antistasi Ultimate by and for House Kandosii

# Lore
	This mod aims to add Antistasi-specific factions that follow the following lore:

		Late into the Galactic Civil War and after the defeat of the Emperor by Luke Skywalker, a number of Mandalorian colonies were annexed by Imperial remnant forces. Previously having renounced war in the name of the late Duchess Satine's ideals, the Mandalorians allowed the Empire to take control, offering no resistance. Initially, it was peaceful; the Imperials mostly kept to themselves, however they slowly began encroaching on the Mandalorian colonists.

		One by one, each settlement began to find an Imperial establishment in their town until eventually, the Imperials felt they were in a position to begin pillaging the planet of all of it's resources, including Mandalorian army surplus such as armor and weapons.

		Correlating with a similar series of events taking place on Mandalore and inspired by resistance fighters under Bo-Katan Kryze and Clan Bes'Agol who were taking up arms against the Imperial remnant, the colonists began to take up arms themselves. Starting with their civilian fatigues and only a few blaster rifles donated from the black market and Mandalorian underground movement, the colonists began to fight back as diplomacy and appeasment failed around them.

		Complicating the matter was a New Republic counter-attack against the Imperial remnant on the planet. While this would normally be cause for celebration, it turned out that the New Republic was not there on behalf of the colonists. Failed treaty negotiations between Bo-Katan Kryze and New Republic diplomats resulted in the New Republic refusing to help Mandalore for fear that their warrior culture would turn on the New Republic, and New Republic military leaders believing that the Empire would prevail against the Mandalorians without New Republic aid did not help matters. As a result, the colonists decided to consider Rebel forces as hostile.

		While the colonists were fighting back, a number of rival insurgencies cropped up. The Mandalorian insurgencies of Death Watch and the Shadow Collective began to get involved with the Shadow Collective wanting to claim territory for their criminal enterprises, while Death Watch was ideologically driven and still looking to bring back the warrior way of the past. A bunch of clones also began to fight, mostly fighting to keep land for their own homes. Even a detachment of the CIS Remnant was deployed to the area, looking to establish a base of operations for an action of vengeance against Clan Bes'Agol's base on Krownest while the bulk of their forces were engaged with the Empire on Mandalore.

		It was at this point that a prominent mercenary and revolutionary group, House Kandosii, got involved in the fighting. Both as a result of their moral compass and the payments put forth by the Mandalorian Colonists, House Kandosii began sending both reinforcments and gear to the colonists.

# Notes
	-This mod will partially serve as a sort of checklist as to what star wars assets Kandosii needs to work on vesus what we already have completed. Anything that is a "soft dependency" (using asssets from another mod for compositions) should eventually be able to be replaced by the House Kandosii Aux Mod
	-Warfare and tactics are not consistent; as a result, factions should be built similarly with the idea of filling multiple roles according to their respective lore description. 
	-Crates for the Galactic Empire should be partially filled with Mandalorian equipment to imply that they are pillaging the planet
	-Mandalorian gear in the crates should be generic and not include customs
	-Custom gear should be available from arms dealer
	-Arms Dealer should have access to all KND Weapons and ammo
	-Death Watch and Shadow Collective should be using varied aftermarket weapons so that they can be captured rather than just Mandalorian guns
	-NO Jedi or Sith.
